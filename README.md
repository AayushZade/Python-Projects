## Introduction

This repository serves as a place to gather and showcase Python projects that demonstrate key programming techniques and skills. Each project covers a different area of Python development, ranging from basic algorithms to more complex applications such as games, automation scripts, and more.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Blackjack Game**:
   - A simple terminal-based Blackjack game where the user plays against the computer.
   - Concepts covered: loops, conditionals, lists, randomization.

*More projects will be added as they are developed.*

## Installation
